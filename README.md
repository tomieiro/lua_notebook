# Lua Notebook
Lua notebook prototype that supports comments.

<h5>BEFORE YOU START:</h5>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>(STEP 1)</strong></em></p>
Initially, some libs are needed: liblua5.3-dev(https://www.lua.org/), libfltk1.3-dev(https://www.fltk.org/) and the lua binaries themselves(https ://www.lua.org/).<br><p>To install them, if you are on Linux, use: <code>make INSTALL_COMPONENTS</p></code>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<p><em><strong>(STEP 2)</strong></em></p>
For the GUI in Lua, we use the lib: MoonFLTK(https://github.com/stetre/moonfltk) by Stefano Trettel. Access the moonfltk link, mentioned above, to learn about the module. The walkthrough is on the repository page if you want to compile it; however, it will already be installed by <code>make INSTALL_COMPONENTS</code>(Comming soon...).
</li>
</ul>
